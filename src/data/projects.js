I worked on redesigning and developing a new front-end system for their online magazine articles. The design was updated by replicating the old design on their website for archival purposes, but new UI elements and animations were added to improve the experience. The front-end was also updated to be less dependent on third party libraries for improving performance and future-proofing.',
